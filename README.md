# PHP REST API 

REST API using Phalcon PHP Framework with a Mysql database connection. The project is about a music rating application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Configure Phalcon library in your php directory. You may follow official site instructions [here](https://phalconphp.com/en/download/linux/).

I strongly recommend to test the application on (https://www.getpostman.com/).

### Installing

Set up a localhost server to serve the php application.

And that's all ^^

## Running the tests

Not automatic tests considered, sorry :(

## Deployment

Just be sure to have phalcon configurated in your php files. Deploy like a normal php application.
